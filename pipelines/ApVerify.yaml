description: Instrumented Alert Production pipeline specialized for ci_dc2
#
# This pipeline does not depend on the local ApPipe.yaml, because the definition
# of the primary ApVerify.yaml is more likely to change than the data-specific
# overrides, and importing both pipelines can't merge changes to the same task.

imports:
  - location: $AP_VERIFY_DIR/pipelines/LSSTCam-imSim/ApVerify.yaml
parameters:
  coaddName: goodSeeing

  rbClassify:
