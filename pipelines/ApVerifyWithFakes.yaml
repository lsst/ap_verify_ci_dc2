description: Instrumented Alert Production pipeline specialized for ci_dc2, wth added fake sources
#
# This pipeline does not depend on the local ApVerify.yaml, because the definition
# of the primary ApVerifyWithFakes.yaml is more likely to change than the
# data-specific overrides, and importing both pipelines can't merge changes to
# the same task.

imports:
  - location: $AP_VERIFY_DIR/pipelines/LSSTCam-imSim/ApVerifyWithFakes.yaml
